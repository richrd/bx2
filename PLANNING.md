# BX2 Planning

## Original BX limitations
 * No setup.py
 * Single server only
 * Unclear API
     * Kludgy event system
 * Kludgy config
 * Custom logging system
     * Bloated command line logging
     * Use logging library instead?
 * Unreliable 'bookkeeping' (tracking users, channels and the bot nick)
 * User privileges are global (No channel specific permissions)
 * IRC lib only has multiple callback events (Can't listen to all events via one callback)
 * Only config and modules can be reloaded, but not the core
     * Would be nice to be able to reload core classes
