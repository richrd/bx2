# BX2 Planning

## Original BX limitations (stuff to fix)
 * No setup.py
 * Single server only
 * Unclear API
 * Kludgy event system
 * Kludgy config
 * Custom logging system
     * Bloated command line logging
     * Should use logging library instead?
 * Unreliable 'bookkeeping' (tracking users, channels and the bot nick)
 * User privileges are global (No channel specific permissions)
 * Custom IRC lib only has multiple callback events (Can't listen to all events via one callback)
 * Only config and modules can be reloaded, but not the core
     * Would be nice to be able to reload core classes
     * Requires serializing all class instances. Only the sockets need to stay.
     * When all the classes are reloaded, they should be re-initialized 

## New Features
 * [X] Multi-server support
 * [X] Rebooting of bot(s) without losing connection
 * [X] Integrated HTTP server (for sending logs, providing API etc)
 * [X] Remotely updating the bot from the github repository
 * [ ] Support server passwords
 * [ ] Verify all core modules before reloading to avoid syntax error crashes
 * [ ] Automatically get a hostname with USERHOST
 * [ ] MAYBE use 005:
       > In early implementations of IRC this had to be hard-coded in the
       > client but there is now a de facto standard extension to the protocol
       > called ISUPPORT that sends this information to the client at connect
       > time using numeric 005.

## Architecture

### IRC Lib
We're using a custom IRC Client library to limit external dependencies (also for learning purpouses)
It's a bit crude with the parsing, but it works well. The new version also emits events instead of relying on callbacks.

### Classes
 * App
     * HTTPServer
         * PycoHTTP
     * Bot
         * IRCClient
         * Event
         * User
         * Message
         * Window
             * Channel
             * Query
             * self.log of channel activity (for logs etc)
         * Module

### Permission system

Basic permissions are defined by an intiger. By default it ranges from 0 to 100.

**Levels:**

 * 0: GUEST - Not truested at all.
 > No special access. This is the default permission level for everyone.

 * 1 - 9: AQUAINTANCE - Slightly trusted.
 > Lowest tier permissions. Might have some basic access that normal users don't have.

 * 10 - 19: FRIEND - Trusted.
 > Can use features such as auto op, getting logs on certain channels etc.

 * 20 - 99: CURRENTLY UNDEFINED

 * 100 and up: OWNER - Can do anything, and potentially run arbitrary code on the server


### Bookkeeping

* [X] Bot
    * [X] Own nick
    * [X] What channels are really joined (check kick etc)

* [X] User status (online/authed/last_action etc).
    * [X] Online
        * [X] When user renames to existing (offline) user two users exist with the same nick (
        * [X] User must be set to online when:
            * [X] They are seen
            * [X] They perform an action
        * [X] User must be set offline when:
            * [X] They quit
            * [X] The bot gets disconnected (no chance of bookkeeping when not connected)
    * [X] authed
        * [X] The user should be deauthed when:
            * [X] They go offline
            * [X] When the bot disconnects
        * [X] The user should be authed when their hostname is trusted or when they auth manually

* [X] Window status
    * [X] Users
        * [X] All users in a window must be cleared when:
            * [X] The bot parts that channel
            * [X] When the bot gets disconnected
        * [X] Modes
        
    * [X] Channel modes
        * [X] Get modes on join
        * [X] Detect mode changes
    
    * [X] Channel topic
    * [X] Log records
        * [X] Store selected events
        * [X] Max amount of records TODO:use value from config

### HTTP Server
 * [ ] Should be running and accessible at all times
 * [ ] Should provide versatile routing
     * [ ] Automatic hierarchial routes should be provided by default
     * [ ] Custm routes should be able to be used too
 * [ ] Should provide good base template for HTML content
 * [X] Should provide generic static resources (e.g. styles, js, images etc.)


### Modules

Modules are python files that implement the required minumum API.
Each file must implement a Module subclass that implements the required features.
Modules respond to their names as a commands, or any events they subscribe to.

**Each module can optionally declare the following:**

 * **name** (the filename without '.py' is automatically the module name)
     > The unique name of the module. If the module can be executed as a command, this is the command name that runs it.
     > *Maybe add an override so that another name can be used for running the command?*

 * **permission_level** (optional, default: 0)
     > The permission level for using the module. By default 0 (available to anyone)

 * **zones** (optional, default: ZONE_ALL)
     > Where the module can be used. Either ZONE_CHANNEL, ZONE_QUERY or ZONE_ALL

 * **throttle*** (optional, default: 1.5)
     > How often the module can be run (interval in seconds)


### Config (global config and defaults)
