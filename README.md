     Super awesome modular Python IRC bot made from scratch.
    
    Come and talk to me at #bxbot @ QuakeNet/IRCNet/Freenode :)


The code can be reloaded live while it's running and the core is extremely resilient to crashing.
It supports multiple servers and hardly ever disconnects. If it does it will reconnect fast.
It also features a HTTP server available for extensions to make use of.
The server is currently used for showing channel logs, but will eventually also host a web interface.

## Features
  * Authentication with different user levels
  * Auto OP (for trusted users)
  * Channel logs available in your browser (for trusted users)
  * Highlight command to highlight everyone on a channel
  * Channel mode enforcing
  * URL title paster
  * Command line interface for managing bot
  * Integrated help for general use and commands
  * Simple to extend with Python
